= Singularity container

You will find two scripts to generate the bootstrap files for feel++ container
images and to generate the singularity image.

```
./generate_bootstrap.sh <dochub>
./generate_image.sh <dochub>
```

For example to generate `feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes`, just do

```
./generate_bootstrap.sh feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes
./generate_image.sh feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes
```

TIP: Bootstrap and image are generated in the corresponding container folder at
the root of the reposity. For example `/feelpp-toolboxes`



= Singularity version changes


For singularity version 2.3, run script and shell script will be located
at
